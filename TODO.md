- Replace custom `Result` and generic `Error`s with `thiserror` and `anyhow` implementation
- convert do_next_query/Querier into a state machine
- make `Answer` and `Outcome` generalizable, so they don't have to be repeated for each `Query`
- replace `Result<Option<..>>` stuff with a custom result type
