# weid

## What is weid?

`wied` is a modular, configurable tool for sequentially prompting the user to answer questions and perform actions.

Realistically, `weid` can be a lot of things:

- A terminal-based menu frontend
- A tool for reviewing/reacting to something
- A quiz/flashcard interface
- A text-based adventure game engine


## Name

And as I'm sure everyone has already guessed, weid's name is derived from the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European root _\*weid-_, which means "to see" or "to know".

_\*weid-_ is an ancestor to such relevant words as _advise_, _review_, _wisdom_, _interview_, _guide_, _idea_, and _history_, and such irrelevant words as _penguin_, _prudent_, _idol_, _envy_, and _twit_.
